# IOCs â€“ ShadowDrop Operation

This file lists all Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) observed during the ShadowDrop simulation. 

What Are IOCs?

Indicators of Compromise = digital clues that suggest a system was attacked, exploited, or touched by malware.

Think:

 - Hashes of malicious files

 - Registry keys used for persistence

 - File paths where malware hides

 - IPs, domains, mutexes, named pipes, etc.

They are like fingerprints left behind at the scene of a cybercrime.

 
These can be used for threat hunting, enrichment, and retroactive detection.
